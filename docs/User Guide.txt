Before running the tool:

1. In the target Jira project, configure the Edit/View Issue screen so that it contains all issue fields you will be importing. 
The import of the whole issue will fail if an unrecognized field is included. See the Jira documentation.
   Fields normally missing from the default Edit/View screen are:
   - resolution 
   - Story Points (n.b. custom field)
   
2. Find id of Story Points custom field (this is a built-in custom id; the id may be different in different Jira instances).
This id must be inserted in the annotation of the story points accessor method in the IssueFields class, e.g. @XmlElement(name = "<id-goes-here>")

3. Create the following custom fields and add them to the Edit/View Issue screen. Then find the id that has been assigned to this field (with a "get" issue rest request). 
This id must be inserted in the annotation of the accessor method in the IssueFields class, e.g. @XmlElement(name = "<id-goes-here>")

4. Find the six "transition" id's for your Jira instance and set these as values of the corresponding properties in the settings.properties file.
  (Cf. comment in settings.properties for more information)
  
5. For users to have access to the Group Picker gui when editing "Team Group" and "Filed Against" fields, they must first be granted the browse_users permission.
