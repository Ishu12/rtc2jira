Before running the tool:

1. In the target Jira project, configure the Edit/View Issue screen so that it contains all issue fields you will be importing. See the Jira documentation.
   Fields normally missing from the default Edit/View screen are:
   - resolution 
   - Story Points (n.b. custom field)
   
 2. Find id of Story Points custom field (this is a built-in custom id; the id may be different in different Jira instances). Insert id in appropriate place in code
 3. Find the six transition id's for your Jira instance and set these as values of the corresponding properties in the settings.properties file. (Cf. comment in settings.properties for more information)
